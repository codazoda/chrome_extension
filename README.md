# Chrome Extension

This is a blank starting point for a chrome extension. To make it your own simply edit the bookmarklet.js file and then load it into Google Chrome.

If you want to edit the name and description, edit the manifest.json file.

If you want to update the icons, just replace the png images with your own in the sizes indicated.
